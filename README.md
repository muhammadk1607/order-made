# Order Made

Order Made is a white label order management platform where companies access their orders table
by going to appropriate subdomains.

## Onboarding New Companies

To onboard a new company, simply add it's logo with a proper name in `public` directory.

Then add an entry in `subdomains.json` with proper title, logo url and the subdomain to be assigned.

As a POC the orders are also added in this JSON for now.
